The repository you are currently in is for educational purposes only - it shows my learning path and my engagement with the Excel world. 

If you are my future employer then I hope you will appreciate the fact that I have recorded my learning history and even if you notice some mistakes or find something outdated/unnecessary I will still leave a good impression.

Each of the files was used in this course:

After this course I am going to do some projects of my own to show that this was not a blind reproduction from a video but actual learning. 

REALLY nothing interesting here but still - enjoy browsing!
